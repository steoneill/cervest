# Ste O'Neills Cervest Test

This app is built with Tailwind, as the out of the box styles can really bring an app together in the time limit given.

## Getting Started

Running the app can be done by first installing the dependencies with `yarn` and then running `yarn dev` to start the app.
Once this is done, navigate to `localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Testing

Testing is in Cypress, this is a little heavy but gives us the confidence needed for dealing with data.
To run the tests, run the app with `yarn dev` and then run `yarn test` in a separate terminal.
Once this is done, press `e2e` and select `Home` and it will run your tests.

## Comments

If i'd had more time, i'd liked to have come up with a more elegant solution for the mobile side of things, and the overall styling could do with a bit more love, but with the time in mind, I've tried to keep it serviceable and functional.
